## Description

**Factoring** a positive integer is decomposing it into a product of one or more integers greater than 1. For example, 12 can be factored as 3×4, 2×6, 2×2×3, or 12.

A **square** is an integer that can be factored as two equal integers. For example, 4 is square because it can be factored as 2×2.

If none of a factoring's factors are divisible by a square greater than 1, let's call it a **non-squarish** factoring. For example, 12 has two non-squarish factorings: 2×6 and 2×2×3.

Given a postive integer, find the shortest possible length of a non-squarish factoring. For example, for 12 the shortest possible length is 2.

## Input

An integer between 2 and 2,000,000 inclusive.

## Output

The shortest length of the integer's non-squarish factoring.
